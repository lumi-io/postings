          These terms and conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the general terms
          and conditions of your use of the why-phi.com website (“Website” or
          “Service”) and any of its related products and services (collectively,
          “Services”). This Agreement is legally binding between you (“User”,
          “you” or “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or
          “our”). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a
          business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
          authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
          terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do
          not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
          agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and
          use the Website and Services. By accessing and using the Website and
          Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to
          be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You acknowledge that this
          Agreement is a contract between you and the Operator, even though it
          is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it governs your
          use of the Website and Services. This terms and conditions policy was
          created with the help of the terms and conditions generator.

          monitor and review new accounts before you may sign in and start using
